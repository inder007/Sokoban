### Sokoban

## Description
Sokoban is a classic puzzle video game where the player pushes boxes or crates around a warehouse, aiming to place them on designated storage locations. The player controls a character in a maze-like environment and can only push boxes (not pull them), making each move critical. The challenge lies in planning the sequence of moves to avoid getting boxes stuck in corners or against walls, thus requiring strategic thinking and problem-solving skills. Originating from Japan in the early 1980s, Sokoban remains popular for its simplicity and depth.
